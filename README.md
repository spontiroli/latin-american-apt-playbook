[The ATT&CK Latin American APT Playbook](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-P2prH21_J8), by Santiago Pontiroli and Dmitry Bestuzhev  
Presented at ATT&CKCON 3.0

Financially motivated cyber-attacks thrive in emerging Latin American markets. However, there's room for locally grown threat actors operating in the cyber espionage field as well. During the last decade, this includes but is not limited to *Blind Eagle, Puppeteer, Machete, Poseidon,* and others. We also saw foreign operations targeting specific assets in Latin America, still connected to certain regional sources.

Since the threat actors' origin, culture, and language is often different, it's not uncommon for tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) to present marked differences. As a result of our regional expertise and experience, we created MITRE's ATT&CK play-by-play mappings to help other analysts understand regional actors. If you are interested in threat intelligence and what's going on in Latin America, this presentation is for you. Our work is based only on real-world attackers and their operations, including those not publicly known, such as COVID-19 Machete's targeted campaign.
